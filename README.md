# ESP-VISTUALIZE

## Working with the garage door open

I found myself with an esp32-s3 and a waveshare RGB 64x32 led matrix.

I'm learning rust and I could use a nice visualization of timers, todos, med reminder, internet status, and many more ideas.

Not sure where the project will go but if you are watching, think of it as me studying/working with the garage door open.

Feel free to watch, hangout, or come help/educate!
